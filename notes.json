        "details": "Kevin Mitnick was born on August 6, 1963, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California. His parents were Alan Mitnick and Shelly Jaffe. He had a maternal grandmother named Reba Vartanian. Mitnick was Jewish and grew up in Los Angeles. \n\nAt the young age of 12, Mitnick demonstrated his early hacking skills by convincing a bus driver to reveal the location where he could purchase a ticket punch. This allowed Mitnick to access any bus in the Los Angeles area using discarded transfer slips found in a dumpster. \n\nMitnick attended James Monroe High School in North Hills, where he became a licensed amateur radio operator with the callsign WA6VPS. This license was later restored after his imprisonment with the new callsign N6NHG. He adopted the nickname 'Condor' after being inspired by the movie 'Three Days of the Condor'. After high school, Mitnick enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and the University of Southern California (USC).",
